	abstract = {Intensification of crop rotation and increasing use of machinery with high wheel loads are clearly related to compaction of the subsoil. Subsoil compaction is persistent and the effect of natural and artificial loosening has been disappointing. Therefore, prevention of subsoil compaction is the best way to preserve the structure and quality of the subsoil. In addition to field studies, there is an increasing need for analytical tools to develop and evaluate measures for preventing subsoil compaction. The objective of the research was to develop such a tool in the form of a computer model suitable for educators and extension workers, professional advisers, agricultural engineers and scientists. The analytical soil compaction model (SOCOMO) was developed to calculate soil stresses under wheel loads. In specific cases, the calculated stresses are compared with soil strengths measured in the laboratory. The calculated stresses were compared with known soil strengths or soil strengths determined with the help of pedotransfer functions. Subsoil compaction and deformation are prevented if the stresses exerted remain smaller than the actual strength of the subsoil. To test the model, traffic experiments were performed and methods developed to measure stress, compaction and deformation in the subsoil caused by wheel load. The test was successful and the model has been used to compare stresses under normal and low-pressure tires, as well as under tandem and dual-wheel configurations. SOCOMO was also used to construct a wheel-load carrying-capacity map of The Netherlands. The model is easy to use and requires only minimal input. However, it is not yet as user-friendly as it could be. Weak points of the model are that the rut depth must be estimated and that the shape of the pressure distribution exerted by the tire on the bottom of the rut is based on rules of thumb. The use of the concept that subsoil compaction can be prevented by keeping the exerted stresses on the subsoil below actual strength is frustrated by the fact that data and pedotransfer functions of soil strength are scarce. More measurements and development of pedotransfer functions are required.},

	abstract = {The crucial role of healthy soil in achieving sustainable food production and environment is increasingly recognized, as is the importance of proper assessment of soil quality. We introduce a new framework, open soil index (OSI), which integrally evaluates soil health of agricultural fields and provides recommendation for farming practices. The OSI is an open-source modular framework in which soil properties, functions, indicators and scores, and management advice are linked hierarchically. Soil health is evaluated with respect to sustainable crop production but can be extended to other ecosystem functions. The OSI leverages the existing knowledge base of agronomic research and routine laboratory data, enabling its application with limited cost. The OSI is a generic framework that can be adopted for specific regions with specific objectives. As a proof of concept, the OSI is implemented for all ({\textgreater}700,000) Dutch agricultural fields and illustrated with 11 pairs (“good” and “poor”) of local fields and 32 fields where soil quality and crop yield have been monitored. The OSI produced reasonable evaluation for most pairs when soil physical functions were refined with on-site soil visual assessment. The soil functions are sufficiently independent and yet together reflect complex multidimensionality of soil quality. The framework can facilitate designing sustainable soil management programs by bridging regional targets to field-level actions.},
